    <h1>European Football Structure</h1>

    <p>
        If we start talking about European football league then some of the club names come up firstly like Real Madrid, AC Milan, Bayern Munich, Liverpool, Barcelona, Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea, Juventus, Inter Milan, Porto, Benfica, PSG. But the interesting thing is that these clubs are playing in different countries of Europe. We will discuss about the top European leagues and the UEFA Champions League. 
English Premier League
On the basis of popularity, The English Premier League of England is at the top. But according to many football experts, the competition of this league is tougher than other Football leagues. The league is broadcasted in 212 territories around the world and watched by 4.7 billion people worldwide. But the position of EPL is second in terms of field attendance according to the data of 2020, the average number of spectators in EPL is 38,181 but in German Bundesliga it is 43500.
The English Premier League had started on 15 August 1992 which is the highest league in English football. Let's know the history of how it started. Football League First Division started in 1889. After almost 100 years in 1980, its popularity began to decline compared to Italian Serie A and Spanish La Liga. After a tragic stadium collapse, England's highest league was canceled from the European League for 5 years. In 1990, the major teams of this division needed economic solvency to improve their training ground facilities, gymnasium as well as Stadium infrastructure. Later on, Sky UK Limited (TV and Internet service provider) had a lucrative offer and English Football Association gave the permission to start the English Premier League. Since then, the Football League First Division has been regarded as England's second-tier league, which was renamed as Football League Championship in 2003-04 and later English Football League Championship in 2016-17. Liverpool won the Football League Fast Division a maximum of 18 times.
In 1992, the English Premier League started with 22 teams but after two years it was reduced to 20 teams. The league is played on a home-away basis i.e. each team plays 2 matches against each other, one at home and the other at the opponents ground. Each team gets 3 points for a win and 1 point for a draw. After all the 38 matches of all teams, whoever has more points wins the league, but if two teams have equal points, the team which is leading on goal difference is declared the winner. The top four teams in the points table are selected for the UEFA Champions League, the fifth and sixth teams are selected for the Europa League and the seventh and eighth teams are selected for the Conference League. The bottom three teams in the table are relegated to the Football League Championship and three teams promoted from the Championship are promoted to the English Premier League.
After the start of the English Premier League, Manchester United, Arsenal, Liverpool, Everton these four teams were considered as big teams, but after 2000, Tottenham developed a good competition. 
Already the popularity of EPL has increased due to its excellent broadcast quality and mellifluent English commentary. As a result, the teams were benefited financially, so they can buy players at a higher price and to renovate their stadium and other infrastructure. New investment coming to the League. Chelsea and Manchester City get new owner with huge economic resource, they bought quality footballers from other teams and leagues to form a strong team. This makes the league even tougher to win and enjoyable to watch. Since its inception in 1992, Manchester United has won the English Premier League the most times, along with Chelsea, Manchester City, Arsenal, Leicester City, Liverpool, Blackburn Rovers.
